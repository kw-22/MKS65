Description of Project:
    This project is a version of a type racing game where players can compete against each other to determine who the faster typer is. Players can also practice on their own.
	In either case, players can see their typing speed in near real time as well as what their accuracy is.
	The racers' progress will be shown in near real time as progress bars in another terminal.
	Players will type excerpts from text files in a provided directory and will also have the option to submit their own entries.

User Interface:
	One computer will act as the server with everyone else connecting as clients. All interaction will be done through terminals.

Technical Design:
	Breakdown:
		Kerwin:
			screen client, stats
		Tahmid:
			player client/server
		Kevin:
			engine

	Topics/Data structures/Algorithms:
		Memory allocation:
			Storage of data.
        Working with files:
			Getting the excerpts requires reading from files in a directory and players are also allowed to create their own excerpts by writing to a file.
		Processes:
			The server will fork off subprocesses that will deal with all the computational work.
		Pipes:
			Communication will be needed between the server and all its clients.
		Semaphores:
			Only one user will be allowed to submit their own entries at a time.
        Networking:
			Users will have to connect to a single game from different computers and will need to communicate and relay their progress.

Timeline:
	1/2/19: Finish up game logistics/mechanics.
	1/4/19: Finish up server/client connections.
	1/8/19: Finish up proper typing mechanism.
	1/12/19: Finish up statistics algo/mechanics.
	1/16/19: Finish all the basics and tidy things up.
